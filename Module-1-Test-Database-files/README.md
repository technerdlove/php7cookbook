# These are values to upload into MySQL in order to carry out the exercises in Module 1

## The original file for the values for the test database in module 1 of the text is here:  

[https://github.com/dbierer/php7cookbook/blob/master/php7cookbook.sql](https://github.com/dbierer/php7cookbook/blob/master/php7cookbook.sql)  


## The problem the files in this folder solves:

- The original file is one long SQL statement, which is too large to execute in MySQL.  
- The DBMS will throw and error stating that the file is too large at around 1.5MB. 
- The original file is therefore split into the 15 files in this folder to feed the commends in logical statement chunks.  
- Each file accomplishes one table creation and data insert.
